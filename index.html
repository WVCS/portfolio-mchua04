      My name is Michael Chua, and I am currently a freshman at Westview High School. I am proficient in HTML and CSS as well as a minute amount of JavaScript. I am also able to smoothly speak Spanish. I enjoy creating websites because it allows me to unleash my creative side.In my free time, I enjoy playing sports and hanging out with friends. I also indulge in sleeping and playing with my dog. I also participate in other extracurricular activites such as hockey and lacrosse.
