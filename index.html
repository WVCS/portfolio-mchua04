      My name is Michael Chua, and I am currently a freshman at Westview High School. I am proficient in HTML and CSS as well as a small amount of JavaScript. I am also able to smoothly speak Spanish. I enjoy creating websites because it allows me to unleash my creative side. In my free time, I enjoy playing sports and hanging out with friends. I also indulge in sleeping and playing with my dog. I also participate in other extracurricular activites such as hockey and lacrosse.

  <a href="NHL.htm" target="_blank" class="link"><div class="item4"><p style="font-size:18px;">This was my very first website. It was made in January 2019 with a total amount of 80 minutes of work for a submission in my Web Design Class.</p><img src="nhllogo.png" style="width:100px;"></div></a>
    <div class="item5"><a href="main.html"><p style="font-size:24px;">Clicking this link sends you to a website I created in collaboration with Morgan 
Feng, which was created about 2 months after my first website was created. This website was also a submission for my Web Design class.</div></a>
